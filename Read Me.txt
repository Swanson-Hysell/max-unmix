The documents and data within this folder form the basis for the MAX UnMix application that can be accessed online at https://maxunmix.shinyapps.io/unmix_v8/. The code for the application can be found in the documents “server.R” and “ui.R”.  

Instructional videos are included within this folder and will be accessible in the application either online or when the application runs locally.

If you will be processing a large amount of data using MAX UnMix you may wish to run the program locally (offline). To run MAX UnMix locally on your own computer follow the steps below.
